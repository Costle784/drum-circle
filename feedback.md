## Feedback
Good job on this project! I left some notes in your code about spacing and some
redundant comments in some of your controllers but generally it's well formatted.

Also find some edits I inserted into some views and controllers pertaining to a
css issue you mentioned about instrument name display size and your concern about
preventing users from selecting multiple instruments. It's not a complete solution,
however. That's where you come in.
