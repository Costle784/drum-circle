Drum Circle is an app designed to connect musicians who are looking to jam. It makes it easier to find and organize jam sessions without having to go sit-in with bands at open mics or stay up all night in smoky jazz clubs in order to meet people and play. Instead, you can do everything from your couch.

One can either create a new jam session, a new drum circle, or join an existing one.

The app uses devise to create users who have the ability to perform 'full crud' (create,read,update,delete) on Jamposts and Comments.   

Jamposts are highly customizable to suit your needs.
